## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-11 - Full Documentation Overhaul (WT v1 Aligned)

### Summary

Comprehensive documentation update to reflect the correct WT reference branch (`v1`, not `master`) and fully document all current and pending PHP features.

### Critical Correction: WT Reference Branch

- **Previous docs referenced `wt/master`** — this was wrong. `master` is the old v0.5.1 with outdated values.
- **All docs now reference `wt/v1`** — the correct redesign branch with the luxury dark theme.
- Fixed all gold color references: `#C9A96E` (v1) not `#D6B25E` (master)
- Fixed all background references: `#0A0C14` (v1) not `#0B0B0F` (master)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-11 - Homepage Rebuild + WT Reference Integration

### Summary

Complete homepage redesign to exactly match the WT Next.js reference repository (v0.5.1).
All colors, layout, spacing, and component structure now sourced directly from WT source files.

### WT Reference Integration

- Established WT repo (`ri.stemma.main.repository.b2e8b5a3-4b79-4e84-ae4e-b75249b50c7a`) as official design/layout source of truth
- Added `git remote add wt` workflow to fetch WT source directly
- All future UI work starts with reading the relevant WT component first
- ⚠️ Note: this session used `wt/master` (v0.5.1) — corrected to `wt/v1` in v1.2.0

### Design System Changes (from WT `master` globals.css — see v1.2.0 correction)

| Token                    | Old Value | New Value (applied in v1.1) |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------- |

| `--color-gold-accent`    | `#C9A96E` | `#D6B25E`                   |
| `--color-text-primary`   | `#1A1A1A` | `#F4EDE4`                   |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#888888` | `#9A9490`                   |
| `--color-shop-btn-bg`    | `#1A1A1A` | `#D6B25E`                   |
| `--color-shop-btn-text`  | `#FFFFFF` | `#0B0B0F`                   |

All features, design, and product concepts preserved. Technology stack replaced entirely.

### Stack Changes

| Layer         | Before                         | After                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |

| Database      | Supabase (PostgreSQL)          | Hostinger MySQL                           |
| Auth          | Supabase Auth (JWT)            | PHP Sessions + bcrypt                     |
| Image Storage | Supabase Storage buckets       | Local uploads/ folder (GD compression)    |

| Build Step    | `pnpm build`                   | None                                      |

### Documentation Updated

- `01-MASTER-PROMPT.md` — Rewritten for PHP/MySQL role and tech stack
- `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` — Full PHP architecture: routes, folder structure, DB schema, data flows, security
- `03-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` — PHP patterns, config system, deployment, troubleshooting
- `00-SESSION-START-PROMPT.md` — Updated context summary and example prompts

### Architecture Decisions

- PHP sessions over JWT (simpler on shared hosting, no library needed)
- INT AUTO_INCREMENT PKs over UUIDs (better MySQL performance)
- PDO prepared statements (security, consistency)
- GD library for image compression (built into PHP, no install needed)
- Vanilla JS only (no build step, works on shared hosting)
- `.htaccess` URL rewriting for clean URLs
- `includes/config.php` as single source of truth (mirrors original `lib/config.ts`)
- Local `uploads/` folder (Hostinger 20GB disk, no external storage API)
- CSRF tokens on all POST forms (security best practice)

### Features Preserved (All from v0.5.1)

- ✅ Public creator storefront (/username)
- ✅ Creator auth (email + password)
- ✅ Creator dashboard (stats + outfit list)
- ✅ Create / Edit outfit (up to 15 products)
